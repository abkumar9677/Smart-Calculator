# Smart-Calculator
A simple calculator which can operate when user input text as " add or multiply 2 and 3.".... and so on.
I usually made this with the basic python data which any beginner can use. This consists of dictionaries and list.
With the help of list, I created the responses that calculator have to give. And through dictionaries, input is scanned for keywords and numbers.
