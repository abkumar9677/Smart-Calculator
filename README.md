# Smart-Calculator
A simple calculator that can operate when the user input text as " add or multiply 2 and 3.".... and so on. I usually made this with the basic python data which any beginner can use. This consists of dictionaries and lists. With the help of the list, I created the responses that the calculator has to give. And through dictionaries, the input is scanned for keywords and numbers.
